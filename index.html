Best?
</div>
Let's first start with comparing the RAM memory, you can see that Samsung works with an 8 or 10 GB RAM and iPhone with a 4 GB RAM. You can see that Samsung has won this one with a really big difference. For storage Apple wins, because Apple has more options to chose, but the best option for both phones are the same. If you compare the batteries you can see that Samsung won with 3500 mAh against Apple’s 3110 mAh. Because the iPhone 11 contains fast charging and Samsung does not, the charging goes to Apple. With the sizes of the phones there is a really small difference, the iPhone is a bit wider and deeper but it also weighs more. In this case there is not really a winner, because size does not matter. If we compare the camera, Apple has more options for the camera, but Samsung has a better zoom. So Apple has a better camera.<br> 
To conclude, as we compared the two phones the Samsung galaxy note 10 has better statistics than the iPhone 11. To answer the question which is superior, Samsung is the better phone.
